Before implementing these features, you need to set up your WebFinger and actor object. Additionally, you must implement the required handler objects. For simplicity, weâ€™ll use Python for this implementation. Once you have both the WebFinger and handler objects set up, you can use the following example to send a follow request to another user on ActivityPub instances.

### Example: Simple Python Program to Send a Follow Request

```python
# Assuming the signing algorithm is implemented in KeySigningHandler.py in the same directory
import requests
from ActivityHandler import *

# URL pointing to your actor object
actor_id = "https://noah.netlify.app/noah/actor.json"

# Path to the private key generated using the signing algorithm
private_key_path = "..."

# WebFinger of the user you want to follow
webfinger = "@alice@mastodon.social"

handler = ActivityHandler(actor_id, private_key_path)
handler.send_follow_activity(webfinger=webfinger)
```
**Requirements:**

1. URL pointing to your actor object.
2. WebFinger of the person you want to follow.

**Structure of a `@Follow` Activity:**

```json
{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "type": "Follow",
    "actor": "{YOUR_ACTOR_OBJECT_URL}", 
    "object": "{TARGET_ACTOR_OBJECT_URL}"
}
```
